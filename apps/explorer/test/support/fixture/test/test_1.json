If Bitcoin Cash gets majority of Proof-of-Work then it becomes de facto Bitcoin. It will be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks, without changing the economic rules of the Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash will be a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, one-to-one.","zh":"","zh-tw":"","ko":"비트코인캐시는 비트코인 블록체인에서 하드포크되어 나온 비트코인캐시 블록체인에서 사용되는 가상화폐입니다. 하드포크란 인위적으로 블록체인을 분절하는 작업을 의미하며, 비트코인캐시의 하드포크는 2017년 8월 1일에 시행되었습니다. 비트코인을 보유하고 있던 사용자들은 같은 양의 비트코인캐시를 추가로 받았으며, 이 방식으로 기존 비트코인의 채굴량만큼 배포되었습니다.\r\n\r\n하드포크에 대한 논의는 1MB로 제한되어 있던 비트코인의 블록 크기에서 시작되었습니다. 비트코인은 단기간에 급격히 성장하며 거래가 많이 늘었는데, 블록 크기는 그대로여서 높은 수수료를 내지 않으면 거래 승인이 지연되는 문제가 발생했습니다. 이에 대해 세그윗과 블록 크기 증대라는 두 가지 해결방안이 고안되었고, 비트코인 네트워크는 세그윗에 합의했지만 이에 반대하던 세력들이 존재했습니다. viaBTC과 비트메인을 주로 하는 블록 크기 증대 지지자들은 세그윗을 실행하는 비트코인에서 하드포크했으며, 분리된 블록체인을 비트코인캐시로 부르게 되었습니다. 현재 비트코인과 비트코인캐시는 별개의 블록체인으로 운영되고 있습니다. \r\n\r\n코인 특징\r\n1. 비트코인캐시 블록체인은 블록 크기를 2MB부터 8MB까지 유동적으로 확장할 수 있는 Bitcoin ABC 기술을 적용했습니다. 기존 1MB의 블록 크기를 증가시킴으로써, 한 블록에 들어가는 거래의 수량을 늘릴 수 있게 되었습니다. 따라서 기존 비트코인보다 더 낮은 수수료를 지급해도 되고, 더 빨리 컨펌을 받을 수 있게 됩니다. 이 방식은 세그윗과 다른 접근으로 비트코인 스케일링 문제를 해결합니다. \r\n\r\n* 세그윗이란 프로토콜의 서명 부분을 개선함으로써, 블록 크기를 증가시키지 않아도 4MB로 확장된 것과 같은 효과를 내는 스케일링 방법입니다. \r\n\r\n2. 2016개의 블록마다 난이도를 조정하는 비트코인과 달리, 비트코인캐시는 6개의 블록마다 난이도를 조정합니다. 하드포크될 당시 비트코인의 높은 난도를 그대로 가져왔는데, 비트코인과 달리 해쉬파워가 많지 않아 블록 생성에 긴 시간이 소요되었습니다. 현재 이는 조정 중이고, 평균 10분을 맞추기 위해 노력 중이라고 합니다.","ar":"","th":"Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of \u003ca href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e with a protocol upgrade to fix on-chain capacity.
